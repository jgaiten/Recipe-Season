# Recipe-Season
This is the repository for my website created for my UNCA Capstone project for my Computer Science degree.

The purpose of the website is to gather a list of priced foods from different local stores (in this case it is going to focus on the local Asheville area near UNCA), then
compare the prices between them to determine the best quality, and cheapest price.
